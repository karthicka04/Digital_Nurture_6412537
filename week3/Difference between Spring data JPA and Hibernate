1. Type
    
    Hibernate is a full-fledged Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that allows mapping of Java objects to database tables.
    Spring Data JPA is a data access abstraction layer built on top of JPA and Hibernate. It simplifies data access using auto-implementations.

2. Boilerplate Code

    Hibernate requires more boilerplate code to handle common operations such as CRUD and queries.
    Spring Data JPA significantly reduces boilerplate code by offering auto-generated implementations for repositories.

3. Query Support

    Hibernate supports HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and native SQL.
    Spring Data JPA supports derived queries, JPQL, native SQL, and custom queries using the @Query annotation.

4. Custom Queries

    In Hibernate, developers need to manually write custom queries using HQL or the Criteria API.
    Spring Data JPA allows for auto-generation of queries and also supports custom queries using annotations.

5. Default Transaction Management

    Hibernate requires manual transaction handling or integration with Spring’s transaction management.
    Spring Data JPA seamlessly integrates with Spring Boot’s transaction management system.

6. Pagination and Sorting

    Hibernate requires manual configuration for implementing pagination and sorting using Criteria or HQL.
    Spring Data JPA provides built-in support for pagination and sorting using Pageable and Sort interfaces.

7. Learning Curve

    Hibernate can be challenging for beginners due to its complexity and requirement for deep understanding of ORM principles.
    Spring Data JPA has a smoother learning curve, especially when used within the Spring Boot context.

8. Integration

   Hibernate can be used as a standalone ORM tool or with the Spring framework.
   Spring Data JPA is designed specifically for the Spring ecosystem and integrates tightly with Spring Boot.

9. Unit Testing

   Unit testing with Hibernate often requires complex mock setups.
   Spring Data JPA makes unit testing easier with annotations like @DataJpaTest.

10. Use Case

   Hibernate is ideal for complex systems that require fine-grained control over the persistence layer.
   Spring Data JPA is suitable for standard applications that prioritize rapid development and simplicity.
